We are actively engaged and dedicated in restoring many audio and video materials from 60’s to early 70’s containing literary materials, dharma teachings, cultural programs and so forth that are of historical and cultural importance to the Tibetan people. We found many of these treasures collecting dust at run down storages and neglected private collections in India and Nepal.

Materials, both video and audio, like these are of prime importance to our literature, culture and religion. We want to make an effort to identify and preserve such legacy so that they can live beyond their authors and benefit all. We will keep you updated.

If you need to get intouch with us please email info(at)youngtibet.com Again, thank you very much. Your presence is appreciated, The Conserve Tibet Team.
